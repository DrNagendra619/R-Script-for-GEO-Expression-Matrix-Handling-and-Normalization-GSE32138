A laboratory stock of rgRSV244 (Hallak et al., 2000) was propagated in HEp-2 cells, and RSV infectivity was determined by plaque assay. hAEC cultures were exposed to 2 x 10^5 PFU influenza Udorn (MOI of apical cells of 1), 1 x 10^6 PFU rgRSV244 (MOI of apical cells of 5), or mock treated for 2 h, and harvested after 24 and 48 hours of incubation, respectively.","Human airway tracheobronchial epithelial cells from non-cystic fibrosis patients were obtained from airway specimens resected at lung transplantation following Nationwide Children’s Hospital Institutional Review Board-approved protocols. Epithelial cells were removed from the mainstream bronchi by protease digestion and plastic adherence, and plated at a density of 300,000 cells per well on permeable Transwell-Col supports. Cultures were maintained under air-liquid interface (ALI) for 4 to 6 weeks to form well differentiated, polarized cultures that resemble the in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium as previously described (Pickles et al., 1998).","total RNA","RNA was isolated from the AEC cultures after direct lysis of cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and application of the resulting aqueous phase to Qiagen RNeasy Mini Columns. 2 ug of total RNA was reversed transcribed in a 20 ul volume using Applied Biosystem’s high capacity reverse transcription Kit. mRNA expression was determined for 1ul of cDNA with the PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green dye and gene specific primers designed using Primer express software. Primer sets for the P protein of RSV were (F) 5’ AGTGCAGGACCTACATCTGCTC and (R) 5’ AGCTGTTGGCTATGTCCTTGG , while for the NP protein of Influenza virus  were (F) 5 ’ CCAGGAAATGCTGAGATCGAAG  and (R)  5’ TACACACAGGCAGGCAGACAAG 3’. Data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), for which the set of primers we used were (F) 5’ GCAAATTCCATGGCACCGT and (R) 5’ TCGCCCCACTTGATTTTGG. The fold increase in mRNA expression was determined using the ddCt method with mock-treated cultures as calibrator.","Cy3","The concentration of the samples provided was determined using the NanoDrop® ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. RNA samples were analyzed by the FGC using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer Lab-On-A-Chip Agilent 6000 Series II chip to determine the integrity of the samples. The RNA was of high quality and all samples passed our QC cutoff. Sample labeling and hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols.","9606","Hybridization was performed following the manufacturer's protocols","Microarray slides were hybridized overnight, washed and then scanned with Agilent G2505C Microarray Scanner. This high resolution scanner represents the very latest technology from Agilent for Arrays and features an industry-leading extended dynamic range of 106 (20-bits) for high sensitivity scanning without saturation, low-level detection resulting from optimized precision optics, broad dynamic range, minimal spectral cross talk that enables detection of weak features. The information about each probe on the array was extracted from the image data using Agilent Feature Extraction 10.5 (FE). This data is stored in the FE “.txt” files. The raw intensity values from these files is imported into the mathematical software package “R”, which is used for all data input, diagnostic plots, normalization and quality checking steps of the analysis process using scripts developed in-house by Peter White specifically for this analysis.","gene expression after 2h rsv infection (harvested 48h after treatment)","Preprocessing refers to the procedures used to convert raw probe intensities into useful gene expression measurements. For analysis of Agilent Expression data this process consists of : Reading in the FE extraction files and extraction the median intensity values for each probe on the array. These intensities are not background corrected (this has been shown to only introduce noise), but are corrected for any scanner offset that was added to the original raw values (see Analysis Log file for details). The dataset is filtered to remove positive control elements and any elements that have been flagged as outliers. Present (P), Marginal (M) or Absent (A) calls are made for each element on the array using in-house methodologies that take into account both the results of FE probe detection statistics and the intensities of the negative controls elements on the array. Data normalization is the process of removing unwanted non-biological variation that might exist between arrays in a microarray experiment. Sources of such variation might include scanner-setting differences, the quantities of mRNA hybridized, processing order and many other factors. Regardless of the normalization approach used, the underlying assumption of the normalization algorithm is that the number of genes changing expression between conditions is relatively small or that an equivalent number of genes increase and decrease in expression. Agilent One-Color Analysis: The median green (Cy3) intensities are normalized between the arrays using the Quantile Normalization package in “R” (Bolstad et al., 2003). Quantile normalization is a non-linear probe-level normalization that results in the same empirical distribution of intensities for each array.This is a significantly more robust approach than simply normalizing to the median value of each array. The expression of each condition was normalized to its respective control: Influenza infected hAECs were normalized to the median of the Mock_Flu samples and RSV infected hAECs were normalized to the Mock_RSV samples. For the latter Genespring GX v7.3.1 was used.","GPL6480","IOANNIS,,IOANNIDIS","ioannis.ioannidis@nationwidechildrens.org","614-355-3038","FLANO LAB","VACCINES AND IMMUNITY","NATIONWIDE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL","700 CHILDRENS DRIVE","COLUMBUS","OH","43220","USA","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM796nnn/GSM796535/suppl/GSM796535_US85103615_251485053711_S01_GE1_107_Sep09_1_4.txt.gz","41078","primary polarized airway epithelial cells"
